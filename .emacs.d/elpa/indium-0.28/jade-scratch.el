;;; Commentary:

;; Open a scratch buffer with `jade-scratch'.

;;; Code:

(require 'jade-interaction)
(require 'jade-repl)

(defun jade-scratch ()
  "Pop to the scratch buffer.
If no scratch buffer exists for the current connection, create
one first."
  (interactive)
  (pop-to-buffer (jade-scratch-get-buffer-create)))

(defun jade-scratch-get-buffer-create ()
  "Return a scratch buffer for the current connection.
If no buffer exists, create one.

If there is no current connection, throw an error."
  (unless jade-connection
    (user-error "No current connection"))
  (let* ((url (map-elt jade-connection 'url))
         (bufname (jade-scratch-buffer-name url))
         (buf (get-buffer bufname)))
    (unless buf
      (setq buf (get-buffer-create bufname))
      (jade-scratch-setup-buffer buf jade-connection))
    buf))

(defun jade-scratch-buffer-name (url)
  "Return the scratch buffer name for URL."
  (format "*JS scratch %s*" url))

(defun jade-scratch-setup-buffer (buffer connection)
  "Setup the scratch BUFFER for  CONNECTION."
  (with-current-buffer buffer
    (js2-mode)
    (jade-interaction-mode)
    (setq-local jade-connection connection)
    (setq-local company-backends '(company-jade-repl))
    (jade-scratch-insert-welcome-message)))

(defun jade-scratch-insert-welcome-message ()
  "Insert a welcome message to help use the scratch buffer."
  (insert "// This buffer is for JavaScript evaluation.
// Press C-x C-e to evaluate the last expression.
// Press C-c M-i to inspect the last expression.\n\n"))
